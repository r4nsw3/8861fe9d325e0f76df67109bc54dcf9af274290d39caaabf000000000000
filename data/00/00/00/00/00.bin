  |   You're moving to the valley...                                        |

  |   You've inherited your grandfather's old farm plot in Stardew          |
  |   Valley. Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out    |
  |   to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn   |
  |   these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won't be easy. Ever   |
  |   since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all    |
  |   but disappeared. The community center, once the town's most vibrant   |
  |   hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of   |
  |   opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to   |
  |   restore Stardew Valley to greatness!                                  |
